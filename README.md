# Contracts Æpp

## Overview

This is a simple Web Application that demonstrates Aeternity Contracts.

### How it works

1. Select a node
2. Add your private and public keys
3. Write an [Aeternity contract](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/tree/master/contracts) in [Sophia](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/contracts/sophia.md)
4. Compile it by hitting "compile"
5. Deploy it to the chain hitting "Deploy"
6. Test other functionalities (call data, static function and function)
